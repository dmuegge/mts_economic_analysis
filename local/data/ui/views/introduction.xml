        Welcome to Economic Analysis for Splunk!<br></br><br></br>
        
        The goal of this application is to give users of Splunk and public econmic data another option to use and agregate that data.<br></br><br></br>
        
        The first source this application utilizes is FRED which is the Federal Reserver Economic Database. It has a wealth of information and is widely used.
        It has a large repository of data, but limited features to process, analyze, and visualize the data.<br></br><br></br>
        
        Using the FRED Add-On for Splunk to easily index the FRED data will make the data available to this application. The default data sources will populate the prebuilt
        dashboards, but additional data sources can be added and additioanl dashboards created.
