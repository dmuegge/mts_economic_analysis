# Economic Analysis for Splunk

## Introduction
### Welcome to Economic Analysis for Splunk!

The goal of this application is to provide users of Splunk easy access to public economic data.

The first and primary data source this application utilizes is FRED®, which is the Federal Reserve Economic Database. It is a widely used source of economic data and has a wealth of information. There are hundreds of data sources available from this repository this application uses many, which include the following:

- Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)
- U.S. Department of the Treasury
- U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
- U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics
- National Bureau of Economic Research
- U.S. Census Bureau
- S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC
- NASDAQ OMX Group


"This product uses the FRED® API but is not endorsed or certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis."

Using the FRED Add-On for Splunk to easily index the FRED data will make the data available to this application. The default data sources will populate the prebuilt dashboards, but additional data sources can be added and additional dashboards created.

Other data sources may be added to this application in the future based on the availability of additional applicable add-ons.
