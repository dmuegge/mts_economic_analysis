        <h3>Data Overview</h3>
        A fundamental aspect of this application to understand is how the data is organized.  
        The FRED速 Add-On for Splunk installs a kvstore list called FRED_Default_List. This list is used to store the FRED series ID's for which we want to retrieve data.
        When the default list is populated initially using the initial setup page in the FRED速 Add-On for Splunk and the default list input is configured. 
        The FRED速 Add-On for Splunk will begin to download all of the FRED data series in the list. 
        The default data is used to poulate the dashboards in this application.

        <h3>Index Setup</h3>
        
        The index referenced in this app is configured in the `mts_econ_indexes` macro and is configured to use the index fred_data by default. 
        The installation and configuration instructions for the FRED速 Add-On for Splunk recommend creating the fred_data index before configuration. If a different index name was used for the FRED data then update the `mts_econ_indexes` macro accordingly.
