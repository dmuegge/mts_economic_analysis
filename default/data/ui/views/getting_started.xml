        A fundamental aspect of this application to understand is how the data is organized.  
        The FREDÂ® Add-On for Splunk installs a kvstore list called FRED_Default_List. This list is used to store the FRED series ID's for which we want to retrieve data.
        The FRED Add-On has a form for managing this list, but there is also a form to search and manage this list in this application. <br/><br/>
        
        Just click default-->FRED Default List in the application menu, as shown below.<br/><br/>
